                Hey! A <a href="phd-apps/cc_to_phd_calc.pdf">back-of-the-envelope calculation</a> shows that Given that a student attended community college before getting a STEM
            bachelors at a four-year university, she/he is approximately 13x less likely to complete a STEM PhD
            than if she/he started her/his education at a four-year institution. As an (ex) community college student -- I am passionate about changing that!

            <br><br>
            I plan to use this page as a home-base for community college transfer students specific research resources. If you are interested in reading more, see my <a href="phd-apps/cc_to_phd_story.pdf">PhD application diversity statement</a>.  

            <br><br>
                This past fall, I spoke as the only transfer student on the research panel at the <a href="https://etransfercenter.seas.ucla.edu/engineering-day/">UCLA Engineering Day</a>. During winter, I plan to speak at my alma-mater, Las Positas Community College. For Spring23' I am planning research-oriented events for UCLA's transfer events. I will create permanent resources and house them here ðŸ˜„.
