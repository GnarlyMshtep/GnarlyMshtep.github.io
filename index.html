                <p class="main-description">Hello! I am an undergraduate at UCLA, studying computer science and
                    mathematics, and currently, I am working with Dr. Mark Burgin on the axiomatic theory of algorithms.
                    When I am not pondering abstract problems in and out of the standard curriculum, I enjoy
                    collaborating on various software projects, read philosophy, exercise, design clothes for myself and
                    for others, surf, snowboard, and, more often than not, let my curiosity takeover and spend way too
                    much time on wikipedia. Next year, I intend to apply for graduate school and pursue a PhD in
                    theoretical computer science.</p>

            <h4 class="section-title">Academic Intrests</h4>
            (NEEDS EDITS)
            <p>At large, even though I am primarily computer science and mathematics, I would claim to be fascinated with
                philosophy, and physics. At this early point of my academic journey, I don‚Äôt feel quite comfortable stating
                specific (aimed) areas of work or expertise, particularly seeing that I can‚Äôt help to enjoy every single
                course I take and frantically curious about any technical term I hear, but, for those interested in some
                further categorization, I am mostly interested in ‚Äúpurish‚Äù areas lying in the intersection of maths and cs
                such as complexity, cryptography, and algorithms.
            </p>
            
            <p>To compensate for my high-uncertainty range about my desired field of expertise, for those out there still
                hoping to understand ‚Äúwho is Matan Shtepel?‚Äù I did my best to articulate what drives my particular scholarly
                curiosities, and then, my academic ambitions. The following lists may not be entirely exhaustive, but hey,
                they are something. If the following seems a bit romantic, well, that means you really are learning about me :)
            </p>
            
            <p>For starters, I have always, still do, and likely always will, have a deep appreciation for order, rules,
                and structure, which I now understand are the only ways to exceed our inborn biases and human notions, but
                more personally, I think games without rules are simply no fun -- at least not in an intellectual-challenge
                sense, which bring me great joy. That being said, there are few things that I find as fulfilling as tackling
                hard tasks, distinctly those which demand a combination of creativity and deductive reasoning. As painful as
                the process leading up to it often is, I find the moment in which my brain switches from the ‚ÄúI have no
                knowledge at all of this strange coalescence of phrases and symbols‚Äù state to ‚ÄúI understand!‚Äù virtually
                addicting. Beyond such practical concerns, I am driven by the beauty of subjects I am so fortunate to study,
                and this is tougher to describe as its not ‚Äúrational‚Äù or explicit, perhaps its about admiring successful
                information compression or the awe of the achievement of my fellow ape-descendants, but when I watched a
                Bertnard Russel interview, studied the fundamentals of topology, or get the first glimpse of Turing
                Machines, my heart was just filled with incredible feeling -- truly indescribable.
            </p>
            
            <p>Simply (and naively) stated, I am pursuing a career in academia because I believe contributing to the
                ever-growing pool of human knowledge and training others to do the same is the most noble way I can spend my
                life/finite time on this earth, and beyond, as far as my limited predictive powers enable me to see, I think
                I will find deep happiness within that career. Being able to deeply delve into a topic without a brow raised
                and a ‚Äúyou are thinking too much‚Äù stated, is a privilege I am willing to work hard for. I must say, from
                time to time I do struggle with the infatuation of visions of fame and glory, but I do my best to stick to
                my purest motives and let the many reasons and experiences above determine my life-long ambitions.
                While it‚Äôs both difficult to explicitly articulate and awkward to self-state, I would say my burning
                curiosity, not quite fixated on application, chasing a paramount understanding of the space of ideas, and
                thirsty for an earnest challenge.

                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Proof Technique:</u> While contradiction (and the entire idea of the law of excluded
                            middle), diagnolization proofs are extremely beutifull in it's immediate simplicity
                        </li>
                        <li><u>Song:</u> This one is perhaps more subjective, but <a

                            Floyd has an unparallaled affect on my mood -- Headphones on, eyes shut, and any prior
                            distress immediately vanishes -- I promise! give it a listen.</li>
                        <li><u>Programming Languge:</u> By any traditional paramters, it is clearly, <b>not</b> the
                            best
                            programming language, but with an ecosystem richer than the Jeff Bazeos and VSCode which
                            makes it incredibely fun to write, JavaScript must be my favorite language to make web,
                            desktop,
                            and mobile apps. Python is still better for quick-scripts</li>
                    
                    <li><u>YouTube Video:</u>There are many, but this <a

                        the
                        orthogonality thesis has changed the way I look at the world and first peaked my interest in
                        Hume's writing.</li>
                    <li><u>YouTube Channel:</u> <a

                        absolutely no doubt.</li>
                    <li><u>Podcast:</u> <a href="https://lexfridman.com/podcast/">The Lex Fridman Podcast</a> is
                        second
                        to none. If you are looking for an episode to start on and you are philosophy/math inclined,
                        I may reccomend #158 with Zev Weinstein
