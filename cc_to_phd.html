                <p class="main-description">Howdy! 
                    Before arriving at UCLA, I spent a transformative year at Las Positas Community College where I developed my aspiration to become an academic. Unfortunately, I found out that the current academic system is not well suited for inspiring or enabling (ex) community college to join the research ranks. 
                    <br><br>
                    Well -- I'm quite passionate changing that! Thus, I am working with the <a href="https://etransfercenter.seas.ucla.edu/">UCLA engineering transfer center</a> to create a resource page to encourege and assist community college students to participate in research. The page will be hosted on the webpage of the UCLA engineering transfer center and will also be mirrored here. So far, I've had the privelage of being the only transfer on the <a href="https://etransfercenter.seas.ucla.edu/engineering-day/">UCLA engineering day panel</a>.
                    <br><br>
