                <p class="main-description">
                    Howdy! This is Jacob Zhang and Matan Shtepel's demo of our construction (with collaborators -- see Beamer) of the most preforment (in some meaningful respects), semi-honest, Distributed Oblivious Random Access Memory (DORAM) to date. We presented this demo at  <a href="https://hacklodge.org/">Hack Lodge Winter23'</a>, which was a fantastic experience! 
                    Here is the <a href="https://matanshtepel.com/DORAM/HackLodge_beamer.pdf">Beamer presentation</a> we used, our paper (will be linked once on eprint), and a recording of our live demo (will be made avalabile if ever online).
                    
                    During the demo, we deployed DORAM on AWS, and audience members were able to enter this webpage to query it live. Currently, DORAM is not running live, so there is nothing to query. In the near future, we will make the DORAM code avalabile online, and you would be able to run DORAM and test query it (with minimal config) via this frontend! Until then: please enjoy the dead form :)
