                <p class="main-description">
                    I asked you (and some others) to hang out, and you responded with "Who's coming? What are we doing?" (call these and like questions Q), and instead of simply answering, like an annoying, condescending, little bitch, I referred you to this webpage. Please, let me explain. <br>

                    My friends are important to me and hanging out with them uplifts me. As such, I try to coordinate hangouts more often than usual. Conditioned on being fond of each person individually, I invite anyone who comes to mind. In practice, I find that "the more the merrier" usually does hold not only for me but for other participants of the hangout, with slightly unorthodox compositions bringing out amusing scanerios. As you may imagine though, this means I get asked Q quite often. <br>

                   I find Q frustrating because (1) if I invited you to hang out, I must consider us sufficiently good friends to enjoy conversing, just the two of us, for well over two hours. If it is pertinent for you to know who else is attending, perhaps you feel that isn’t so. (2) I don't require RSVPs and embrace the spontaneity of each hangout. That is, obviously, I don’t know the answer to Q.<br>

                    That being said, I am willing to try and answer Q to the best of my abillity if, for instance, you have a personal enemy (e.g. ex-{boy, girl}friend) you are trying to avoid. If you have such outstanding circumstances, please let it be known.  <br>

                    Thank you for dedicating time from your day and reading thus far. I truly hope to see you soon at our hangout. I hope this makes at least some sense.<br><br>

                    Many kisses,<br>

                    Matan.
