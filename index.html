                    Currently I am working
                    under
                    Dr. Mark Burgin in the Axiomatic Theory of Algorithms. When I am not pondering theoretical problems
                    in
                    and out of the standard curriculum, I enjoy collaborating with others on various software problems,
                    particularly web applications, some of which can be seen on my github page. Other than that, I
                    maintain
                    a personal blog, run a fashion brand named <a href="https://rawgnarly.com">GNARLY</a>, snowboard and

            (NEEDS EDITS) With countless facinating topics, I find it nearly impossible to decide in which to
            invest my time. As far
            now, I decided to get involved
            in theoretical computer science for its wide impact on application, and even more importantly, deep
            philosophical implications. Additionally, I remain intrested in a broad depth of subjects, namely
            mathematics, computer science, physics, and philosophy. That is, amongst many
            other reasons, that the cartesian idea of sitting in my (computer)chair and using my mind to discover the
            truths of the world is sorounding me is very romantic and apealing.

                To wrap it up, here are some personal favorites from the many facets of life:
                <div class="split-page-writing">
                    <div class="col1">
                        <ul>
                            <li><u>Proof Technique:</u> While contradiction (and the entire idea of the law of excluded
                                middle), diagnolization proofs are extremely beutifull in it's immediate simplicity
                            </li>
                            <li><u>Song:</u> This one is perhaps more subjective, but <a
                                    href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3kbUFmLV5SHVQonfOpNgkd">San Tropez</a> by Pink
                                Floyd has an unparallaled affect on my mood -- Headphones on, eyes shut, and any prior
                                distress immediately vanishes -- I promise! give it a listen.</li>
                            <li><u>Programming Languge:</u> By any traditional paramters, it is clearly, <b>not</b> the
                                best
                                programming language, but with an ecosystem richer than the Jeff Bazeos and VSCode which
                                makes it incredibely fun to write, JavaScript must be my favorite language to make web,
                                desktop,
                                and mobile apps. Python is still better for quick-scripts</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><u>YouTube Video:</u>There are many, but this <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEUO6pjwFOo&t=2s">this Robert Miles video</a> on
                            the
                            orthogonality thesis has changed the way I look at the world and first peaked my interest in
                            Hume's writing.</li>
                        <li><u>YouTube Channel:</u> <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3b1b</a>-- there is
                            absolutely no doubt.</li>
                        <li><u>Podcast:</u> <a href="https://lexfridman.com/podcast/">The Lex Fridman Podcast</a> is
                            second
                            to none. If you are looking for an episode to start on and you are philosophy/math inclined,
                            I may reccomend #158 with Zev Weinstein
                            or #64 with Grant Sanderson.</li>
