                <p class="main-description">Howdy! We are UCLA's (first?) theoretical computer science community. <br><br>
                    During spring quarter, we will be meeting twice a week (Tu,Th 6-7pm PT) to talk about lattices. We will focus on lattice-based cryptography, but plan touch upon lattices in algorithms and complexity as well. Practically speaking, we will be "taking" <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/CS294/">Vinod Vaikuntanathan's graduate course</a>, discussing the lecture-material, collaboratively solving the problem-sets, and following our curiosity through various digressions. Mathematical maturity is expected, linear algebra is necessery, and cryptography might be helpful.<br><br>
                    
                    If for some crazy reason, that sounds like fun to you, please join <a href="https://discord.gg/2y4NXbZu9M">our Discord Server!</a> Hope to see you there! Feel free to reach out with any questions!<br><br>

                    This quarter, the guild will be ran jointly by <a href="https://matanshtepel.com">Matan Shtepel</a> and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/nakul-khambhati-4647261b6">Nakul Khambhati</a>. Matan, who has graduated Winter23', will be transitioning control of the club to Nakul.
