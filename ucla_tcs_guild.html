                <p class="main-description">Howdy! We are UCLA's (first?) TCS community. During winter quarter, we will be meeting weekly to talk about lattices. We will mainly focus on lattice-based cryptography, but might touch up on the algorithms and complexity of lattices. We vaugly plan to go through (part of) the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/lattices2020">workshops</a> graciously offered by the Simons institue and the <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/CS294/">course</a> graciously put together by Vinod Vaikuntanathan. If for some crazy reason, that sounds like fun to you, please join <a href="https://discord.gg/2y4NXbZu9M">our Discord Server!</a> Hope to see you there!
